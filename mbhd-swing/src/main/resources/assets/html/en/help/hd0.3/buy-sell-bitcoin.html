<h3>Buying and selling bitcoin</h3>

<p>To help users buy their first bitcoin we have teamed up with
  <a href="https://www.glidera.io/referral?client_id=700a89b3cf4ce97d08bb58ea4e550f38" title="Glidera" target="_blank">Glidera</a>. They are a company that
  makes it easy for you to buy and sell bitcoin using your regular bank account.</p>

<h4>General procedure</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Click 'Buy/Sell' on the sidebar to open the wizard.</li>
  <li>Glidera operates in particular countries. These are listed in the descriptive text but their website is more up to date.</li>
  <li>To <strong>buy</strong> bitcoin click the 'Buy bitcoin at Glidera' button. This does two things:</li>
  <ol>
    <li>MultiBit opens a browser at the Glidera login page</li>
    <li>MultiBit creates and reserves a Bitcoin address in your wallet for any bitcoin Glidera sends you. This appears as a regular payment request</li>
  </ol>
  <li>To <strong>sell</strong> bitcoin click the 'Sell bitcoin at Glidera button'. This opens your browser at the Glidera login page.</li>
  <li>After successful login they will provide an address so that you can send them bitcoin.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Will I need to provide identity information ?</h4>
<p>Yes. Like all regulated financial companies, Glidera will require you to provide them with your bank account details and identity documents. This information is
never passed back to MultiBit.</p>

<h4>Will all my MultiBit wallets be linked to Glidera ?</h4>
<p>No. Glidera only require a Bitcoin address from you when you purchase bitcoin. This is similar to making a purchase through a merchant.</p>
<p>If you do not wish to use their service then there is <strong>no requirement to do so</strong>.</p>

<h4>My region is not covered. When can I expect it ?</h4>
<p>Glidera have told us that they intend to cover more regions in the upcoming months. If you sign up to their service, they will be able to keep you informed.</p>

<h4>I accidentally clicked on the 'Buy bitcoin at Glidera' button and now I have a payment request. What can I do ?</h4>
<p>As with all unwanted payment requests they can be deleted as follows:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Go to the Payments screen</li>
  <li>Select the payment request</li>
  <li>Click the 'Delete request' button.</li>
  <li>Repeat for each payment request you wish to delete</li>
</ol>
<p>If you delete a payment request in error, you can use the 'Undo' button to reverse your action.</p>
