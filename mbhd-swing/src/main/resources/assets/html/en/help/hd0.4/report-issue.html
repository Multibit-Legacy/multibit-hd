<h3>Reporting an issue</h3>

<p>We welcome error reports (and your feedback) to improve the software for everyone else. Bear in mind that error reports are for faults with
  the software in normal operation - not for short-lived situations such as a local network problem.</p>

<p><strong>If you are having trouble <a href="send-bitcoin.html">sending</a> or <a href="request-bitcoin.html">requesting</a> bitcoin, first read the dedicated Help
  articles</strong> since they provide specific information to resolve those kinds of problems.</p>

<p>If you are a security researcher you will probably want to read our <a href="/responsible-disclosure.html">responsible disclosure process</a>.</p>

<h4>The easy way (text only)</h4>
<p><strong>Use the <a href="offline-help.html#report-error">"Report error"</a> button on the Help screen</strong></p>

<p>We have implemented an encrypted issue reporting system that will securely provide us with a copy of your log files along with any additional
  information you would like to add in the comment section. We will analyse these logs (usually in aggregate with others) and identify issues arising
  from them. You can <a href="https://github.com/keepkey/multibit-hd/issues" target="_blank">track them here</a>.</p>

<p>The uploaded error report contains the following information:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The last 200Kb of your current logs (your user name is removed)</li>
  <li>Your operating system name and version (e.g. "OS X 10.9.0")</li>
  <li>Your MultiBit version (e.g. "0.5.1")</li>
  <li>Your accompanying notes</li>
</ul>

<p>You can view the error report by clicking the Details button. You cannot edit the report.</p>

<p>The uploaded error report is encrypted with a public key owned by the MultiBit developers and the upload is conducted over a secure connection
  to MultiBit.org. You should <a href="/privacy.html">read our Privacy Policy</a> if you have concerns about how your data will be used.</p>

<h4>Reporting an issue with screen shot</h4>

<p>If you have an issue that requires a screen shot to adequately explain then you will need to use our issue reporting system directly.</p>

<p>Use the approach below to get the fastest response from the support team:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Visit the <a href="https://github.com/keepkey/multibit-hd/issues" target="_blank">MultiBit Issue reporting center</a></li>
  <li>Click on the "New Issue" button.</li>
  <li>Copy the following text:
<pre>
  Bug report
  Operating System:
  MultiBit Version:
  Steps to replicate the problem:
  1. Add your steps here
</pre>
  </li>
  <li>Paste the template text and <strong>fill it in for your computer</strong>. The more detail you can give the quicker we can address the problem.
    Screen shots are often very useful but be sure to hide any sensitive information since they will be public. Do not blur, simply draw a black
    filled rectangle over the personal information to ensure no reverse engineering of the blurring takes place.
  </li>
  <li>Provide a screen shot. On Windows, ALT+PrtScr on Windows then paste into Issue editor. On Mac, CMD+SHIFT+4+SPACE+Click then drag image into Issue editor.
  </li>
</ol>
