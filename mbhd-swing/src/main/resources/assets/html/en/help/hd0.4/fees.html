<h3>Fees</h3>

<p>There are several points where you will likely encounter fees in the Bitcoin network.</p>

<h4>Bitcoin transaction fees (miner's fees)</h4>

<p>It is free to receive bitcoin but sending usually incurs a fee to ensure timely inclusion of the transaction into the block chain. This is
  because Bitcoin relies on people all over the world storing the ever-increasing block chain which consumes valuable resources such as
  network bandwidth and disk storage space. The Bitcoin network is also limited on the number of transactions it can place into a block and as
  such miners tend to prioritise transactions based on their profitability.</p>

<p>If a transaction provides a fee to the miners then it is very likely to be included in the next block, if not then it may take several hours
  for a miner to add it. Since most people want their transactions to go through quickly it is common to add a small fee of a few thousand satoshi.</p>

<p>Transaction fees are calculated based on the size of transaction in bytes in terms of storage rather than the value. The
  rules are a little complicated, but MultiBit will work out the appropriate minimum value to ensure timely inclusion of your transaction into
  the next block where possible.</p>

<p>If you regularly receive lots of very small amounts of bitcoin then you will likely incur larger fees since it will take the inclusion of many
  small inputs to create a sufficiently large output and these take up storage space. If possible you should try to avoid "dust" amounts which tend
  to be under $1 in value.</p>

<p>The Fees panel provides a slider so that you can adjust your default fee setting to better match your day to day use. The default value provides
a good starting position so that it is likely that your transaction will get into the next block, as of Summer 2015</p>
