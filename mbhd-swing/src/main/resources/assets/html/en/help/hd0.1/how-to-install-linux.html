<h2 class="text-center">Thank you for choosing MultiBit HD</h2>

<h4>How to get started</h4>

<p>We have a <a href="getting-started.html" target="_blank">Getting Started guide</a> so you can be up and running with Bitcoin quickly and safely.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ej-technologies.com" target="_blank">Install4j by EJ Technologies GmBH</a> was used to create our installers.
  If you're a Java developer needing an installer solution you should check them out.</p>

<h3>How to install on Linux</h3>

<p>The Linux installer does not come with a pre-packaged Java installation due to the huge variety of Linux distros that are available. Consequently you will need to arrange for a
  suitable JVM to be installed prior to running the installer. We recommend <a href="http://openjdk.java.net/install/" target="_blank">Open Java 1.7.0_72</a>.</p>

<p>Assuming you have a suitable JVM installed and have downloaded the installer to your home directory, do the following at the command shell:</p>
<pre>
cd ~
chmod +x multibit-hd-unix-0.0.5.sh
./multibit-hd-unix-0.0.5.sh
</pre>
<p>After a short time MultiBit HD will show a wizard and install into <code>~/multibit-hd</code>. Your application directory will be <code>~/.multibit-hd</code> and will hold all
  your configuration and wallet files. It will appear on first startup. A basic Unity <code>.desktop</code> file will be created and registered if available so you should be able
  to simply open Unity and search for "MultiBit" to get started (but see later). Alternatively you can run from the command line as follows (you'll see a lot of logging messages
  this way):</p>
<pre>
cd multibit-hd
./multibit-hd &
</pre>

<p>After running the installer you may need to run some scripts to further integrate MultiBit HD into your environment. In particular the <a href="https://buytrezor.com/?a=4fbc03c60545" target="_blank">Trezor</a> support requires certain
  <code>udev</code> rules to be in place. The following sections provide these scripts. If you have a distro that is not included and have a script you'd like to share please let
  us know through the website issue link at the foot of the page.</p>

<h4>Ubuntu</h4>
<p>This script will activate the USB HID rules for Trezor and will ensure that MultiBit HD can respond correctly to Bitcoin links in web pages:</p>
<pre>
#!/bin/sh
echo Activate HID USB...
cat << _EOF_ > /etc/udev/rules.d/99-multibit-hd.rules
# Trezor HID device
ATTRS{idProduct}=="0001", ATTRS{idVendor}=="534c", MODE="0660", GROUP="plugdev"
_EOF_

echo Build Unity desktop...
unityExec=$(ls -d $PWD/multibit-hd)
unityIcon=$(ls -d $PWD/.install4j/multibit-hd.png)
cat << _EOF_ > multibit-hd.desktop
[Desktop Entry]
Version=1.0
Type=Application
Terminal=false
Exec=$unityExec %U
Icon=$unityIcon
Name[en_US]=MultiBit HD
Comment=Secure lightweight international Bitcoin wallet
Comment[en_US]=Secure lightweight international Bitcoin wallet
Name=MultiBit HD
Categories=Network;X-Bitcoin;
MimeType=x-scheme-handler/bitcoin;
_EOF_

echo Install to Unity...
desktop-file-validate multibit-hd.desktop
desktop-file-install multibit-hd.desktop
update-desktop-database

echo Done. Please check the Unity dock.
</pre>

<p>To run it, launch <code>gedit</code> and copy-paste the above and save as <code>~/multibit-hd/post-install.sh</code>. Then do the following:</p>

<pre>
cd ~/multibit-hd
chmod +x post-install.sh
sudo ./post-install.sh
</pre>
<p>When complete you will have a launch icon in the dock that you can locate using "MultiBit" in the search.</p>

<h4>How to run MultiBit HD manually</h4>
<p>You can run MultiBit HD manually as follows:</p>
<pre>
cd ~/multibit-hd
java -jar multibit-hd.jar
</pre>

<h4>My external browser does not launch</h4>

<p>MultiBit HD will first attempt to launch a browser using GNOME libraries and will fall back to <code>xdg-open</code> if that fails. It may be that your
system does not have a default browser available in which case you may need to add one manually.</p>

<h4>I'm seeing a SIGSEV (0xb)</h4>
<p>Some people have had issues using MultiBit HD with OpenJDK on Arch Linux, CentOS and OpenSuse distributions. The error manifests when trying to add a password to a wallet and occurs deep
  within the platform-specific parts of the JVM. If this affects you the error will be like this:</p>
<pre>
SIGSEGV (0xb) at pc=0x00007f97ec7d06a0, pid=588, tid=140289289742080
</pre>

<p>After some research <a href="https://github.com/jim618/multibit/issues/325" target="_blank">members of the MultiBit community</a> found that installing the Oracle Java 7 JVM
  fixed the problem. To install Oracle's JDK do the following:</p>
<pre>
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/java
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install oracle-java7-installer
</pre>
<p>However further research found a reliable workaround involving deleting libscrypt.so from the JAR:</p>
<pre>
zip -d "multibit-hd.jar" lib/x86_64/{freebsd,linux}/libscrypt.so
deleting: lib/x86_64/freebsd/libscrypt.so
deleting: lib/x86_64/linux/libscrypt.so
</pre>

<h4>Clicking a Bitcoin link in Firefox doesn't work</h4>
<p>Assuming that you have installed MultiBit HD and run the post-install script this should work out of the box. However some people have fixed this by manually editing the <code>~/.mozilla/firefox/YOUR_PROFILE.default/mimeTypes.rdf</code>
  file with an entry as follows:</p>
<pre>  &lt;RDF:Description RDF:about="urn:scheme:bitcoin"
                   NC:value="~/multibit-hd/multibit-hd”&gt;
    &lt;NC:handlerProp RDF:resource="urn:scheme:handler:bitcoin"/&gt;
  &lt;/RDF:Description&gt; 
</pre>
<p>Save and restart Firefox and click a Bitcoin URI. It should prompt for a handler and give you the option to make this choice permanent.</p>
