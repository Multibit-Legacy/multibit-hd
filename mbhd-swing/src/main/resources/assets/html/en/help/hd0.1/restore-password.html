<h3>Restore password</h3>

<p>If you forget your wallet password, then you need to restore your password from seed.</p>

<h4>Step 1 - Locate your seed phrase</h4>

<p><strong>To restore your wallet and recover your bitcoin, you must have your seed phrase.</strong></p>
<p>With your seed phrase, you can recover your password, and so recover your bitcoin.  You must keep your seed phrase safe, because <strong>anyone</strong> who knows your seed phrase can restore your wallet, and steal your bitcoin.</p>

<h4>Step 2 - From the Unlock screen select "Restore" then select "Restore password from seed"</h4>

<p>Follow the instructions on the Multibit HD screen.</p>


<h4>If you have also lost your seed phrase, you cannot restore the password</h4>
<p>If you're certain you typed in your password correctly, but MultiBit is not unlocking your wallet, you can:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Make sure that you are using the most recent password you know. </li>
  <li>Try combinations - change one character at a time to upper- or lowercase, swap characters, add a ! to the end and so on</li>
  <li>If the password uses non-English characters consider the effect of the local language miscoding them</li>
</ol>

<p>As a last resort go to a quiet room and relax. Think about where you might have put a copy of the password. Perhaps one of the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Hidden file somewhere?</li>
  <li>USB drive?</li>
  <li>Encrypted copy held on LastPass or KeePass? You should be using a secure password generator with 14 or more random characters.</li>
  <li>Accidental copy on a local backup service like Time Machine or rsync?</li>
  <li>An intentional encrypted copy on Dropbox or GDrive?</li>
  <li>Maybe you wrote it down and put it in a book, or an old drawer?</li>
  <li>Does a trusted friend or relative have a copy?</li>
</ul>


<p>If you have really, truly lost or forgotten both your password and your seed phrase, then it is likely that you have lost access to your bitcoin. There is <strong>absolutely no way</strong> that the MultiBit team can possibly recover them.</p>

<p>You should keep the encrypted wallet files safe just in case inspiration strikes and you somehow remember the password.</p>
