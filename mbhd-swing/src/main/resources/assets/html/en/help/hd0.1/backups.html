<h3>Wallet backups</h3>

<p><strong>So long as you know your seed phrase</strong> you can use a wallet backup to <a href="restore-wallet.html">recover</a>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>your bitcoin</li>
  <li>your contacts and notes</li>
  <li>your payment history and notes.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>You can always recover your bitcoin <a href="restore-wallet.html">through your seed phrase.</a></strong></p>

<p>Hardware and software can fail, be lost or stolen so MultiBit HD ensures that an automatic encrypted backup is made of your wallet
  to a location that you specify.</p>

<p><strong>Data does not exist unless it is in two separate places.</strong></p>

<h4>Use a cloud backup service</h4>

<p>Setting up a cloud backup service is quite straightforward and for small amounts of data (under 2GB) it is often free. We would strongly
  urge you to consider SpiderOak for its end to end encryption. However Dropbox is extremely common and provides an excellent user experience.
  MultiBit HD encrypts all your information locally using a strong AES key derived from your password so it is safe to store the wallet files
  in the cloud without worrying about a malicious administrator being able to read them.</p>

<p>Overall, a good backup is a copy of your wallet file that you regularly store off your computer. That way if something happens to your
  computer you still have access to the backups.</p>

<p>To tell Multibit where your cloud backup is on your computer, use the <a href="edit-wallet.html">"Edit wallet"</a> screen.</p>
