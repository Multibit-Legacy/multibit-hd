<h3>Restoring a wallet</h3>

<p>If your computer is lost, stolen or damaged, or you accidentally delete your MultiBit HD information, then you will need to restore a wallet.</p>

<h4>Step 1 - Locate your wallet words</h4>

<p><strong>To restore your wallet and recover your bitcoin, you must have your wallet words.</strong></p>
<p>With your wallet words, you can recover your bitcoin.  You must keep your wallet words safe, because <strong>anyone</strong> who knows your wallet words can steal your bitcoin
  .</p>

<h4>Step 2 - Locate your wallet backup folder</h4>

<p>A wallet backup is an encrypted copy of your Bitcoin wallet. <strong>Provided you know your wallet words</strong> you can use a wallet backup to recover, in addition to your
  bitcoin:</p>
<ul>
  <li>your contacts and notes,</li>
  <li>your payment history and notes,</li>
  <li>the currencies and exchange rates used in payments.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you followed the instructions in the <a href="getting-started.html">getting started</a> guide then you created  a cloud backup service that continuously uploaded your encrypted
  wallet files to a server somewhere in the cloud. Locate the folder on your computer that is now a copy of your cloud backup folder.</p>

<p>If you don't have a backup but you do have your wallet words then you will be able to recover your bitcoin and any transactions present on the block chain. However, without a
  wallet backup, you will not be able to restore all the extra information such as contacts, notes, payment history, currencies and exchange rates.</p>

<h4>Step 3 - Start the restore process</h4>

<p>From the unlock screen click the "Restore" button and follow the instructions on the MultiBit HD screen.</p>

<h4>If I lost my wallet words why can't I recover my bitcoin with just a backup?</h4>

Because if you could, anyone could.  If your cloud-based backup leaked out of the cloud and onto a thief's computer, the thief could steal all your bitcoin.
