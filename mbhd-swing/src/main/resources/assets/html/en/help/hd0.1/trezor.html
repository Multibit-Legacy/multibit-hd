<h3>Trezor</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://buytrezor.com/?a=multibit.org" target="_blank">Trezor</a> hardware wallet provides a way of keeping your private keys off your desktop machine thereby improving your security.</p>

<p>To use the Trezor device simply attach it using the USB cable (we recommend using a mobile phone cable for maximum reliability) and
MultiBit HD will detect it automatically. After that all screens that involve private key operations (unlocking, sending, signing messages
and so on) will prompt to use the device as part of the work flow.</p>

<p>Where possible MultiBit HD will attempt to match the screen showing on the Trezor so you can be sure no tampering is occurring.</p>

<h4>Buy Trezor</h4>

<p>We recommend that if you have more than 500 USD worth of bitcoin that you <a href="https://buytrezor.com/?a=multibit.org" target="_blank">seriously consider purchasing one</a>. You can start this process from
within MultiBit HD by selecting this option and following the instructions.</p>

<h4>Verify Trezor</h4>

<p>This option will allow you to inspect the "Features" of your Trezor device so that you can tell what version it is, or the digital fingerprint
of the internal firmware. Much of the information is highly technical and generally only needed if you are experiencing problems.</p>

<h4>Wipe Trezor</h4>

<p>This option will allow you to wipe a Trezor back to its factory settings.</p>

<strong>Make sure you have a paper copy of your "wallet words" for the Trezor before wiping!</strong>

<p>Once a Trezor device is wiped there is no going back to the earlier wallet without the "wallet words". If you find yourself needing to do
this MultiBit HD does support Trezor wallet words as part of the Restore process. See the related articles for more details.</p>

<p>The next time the Trezor is attached MultiBit HD will prompt you to initialise the device with a fresh set of "wallet words" generated from
the Trezor itself. These are never revealed to MultiBit HD and remain private to the Trezor device.</p>

<h4>My Trezor is very slow to respond</h4>

<p>Sometimes if MultiBit HD is not shut down properly a connection can be held open to the Trezor resulting in long delays during communication.
The quickest way to resolve this is to simply detach the device and then reattach it. After that it should work as normal.</p>
