<h3>Upgrading MultiBit</h3>
<p>New versions of MultiBit are released containing bug fixes and new features every so often. We recommend you keep your version of MultiBit up-to-date.</p>
<p>This guide tells you how upgrade to a newer version. It is assumed that you have
  reviewed the <a href="help_gettingStarted.html" target="_blank">Getting Started</a> guide and know where all your wallet files are.</p>

<h4>Step 1 - Locate your wallet files</h4>
<p>If you have a standard installation (i.e. you followed our installation notes) upgrading MultiBit should be a seamless process. Your wallet and configuration files will not be in the same directory as the MultiBit application.</p>
<p>Note: You can create new wallets in <strong>any directory</strong> however we recommend you store your wallets and configuration files separate from the
  installation directory.</p>
<p>You can always see the file location of your current wallet in the main title bar of your MultiBit window. For instance, it might say: "MultiBit - My wallet - /Users/jim/Library/Application Support/MultiBit/multibit.wallet". The file name at the end is where your wallet is stored.</p>

<h4>Step 2 (optional) - Move your wallets</h4>
<p>If you have stored your wallets in the MultiBit installation directory (this is not recommended) and want to move the wallets out of this directory then please review the <a href="help_movingAWallet.html" target="_blank">Moving A Wallet</a> article.</p>

<h4>Step 3 - Run the installer/ Mac DMG file</h4>
<p>Download the installer from the <a href="https://multibit.org" target="_blank">official MultiBit site</a> and <a href="/blog/2013/07/24/how-to-check-signatures.html" target="_blank">verify the GPG signature</a> to be absolutely sure you have a legitimate copy.</p>
<p>Follow the <a href="help_installing.html" target="_blank">standard installation instructions</a> for your computer.</p>

<h4>Step 4 - (Windows and Linux only) Run the old version's uninstaller</h4>
<p>Once you are happy with the new version of MultiBit there is a uninstaller shortcut provided so that you can uninstall the older version of MultiBit.</p>
<p>This is not required on Mac OS X since MultiBit.app is simply overwritten.</p>

<h4>Finish</h4>
<p>That's all there is to it. MultiBit will alert you if there is a problem and the <a href="/help.html">main help contents provide answers</a> to many common questions.</p>
