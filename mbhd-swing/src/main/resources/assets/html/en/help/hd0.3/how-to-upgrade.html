<h3>Upgrading MultiBit</h3>

<p>MultiBit is under active development and gets regular updates containing bug fixes and new features.</p>

<p>Whenever the application starts it checks against MultiBit.org for any new updates and if one is found an update process is triggered. This will give you
  the option to upgrade at your convenience.</p>

<p>The upgrade process will usually simply overwrite the old version with the new one. Once the process has completed you will be able to continue working just as you were before.</p>

<h4>Technical details</h4>

<p>The updater process works as follows:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Check <a href="https://multibit.org/releases/multibit-hd/updates.xml">for updates</a></li>
  <li>Present the update wizard as a background process</li>
  <li>Download the latest update if the user gives permission</li>
  <li>Verify the signature against the KeepKey, LLC public key</li>
  <li>Overwrite the existing version</li>
  <li>Launch the new version</li>
</ol>

<p>When the new version of MultiBit is launched it may perform a wallet update to introduce new features or configuration information. During this process any
existing wallets will be automatically backed up.</p>
